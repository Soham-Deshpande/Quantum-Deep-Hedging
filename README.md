# Quantum-Deep-Hedging
MEng Dissertation for University of Southampton:  Analysis of the Quantum Advantages for Deep Hedging.

Parameterised Quantum Circuits (PQCs) have opened many doors, one such being the use in financial markets. In this paper, I look at the problem of developing an accurate market generator through the use of quantum computing for the purposes of hedging. Given a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM), we are able to exploit the high expressibility to generate synthetic data that mimics the statistical distribution of the original dataset. The market generator can then used to simulate an underlying asset to maturity with the intent of learning an optimal hedging strategy, a showcase of a data-driven approach to hedging exposure. I show that the synthetic data produced by this method has shown to capture the fat tails of the market better than classical methods, as well as demonstrating superiority in out-of-sample testing with COVID data. Different generator architectures have been compared to maximise the quality of the synthetic data and avoid issues with barren plateaus. The findings of this research will contribute to the growing literature on risk management in quantitative finance, with applications of the market generator extending beyond deep hedging.
