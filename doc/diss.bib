	abstract = {In many commodity markets, the arrival of new information leads to unexpectedly rapid changes – or jumps – in commodity prices. Such arrivals suggest the assumption that log-return relatives are normally distributed may not hold. This article investigates the potential presence of such jumps in the price of crude oil, both in terms of spot prices and the futures prices. The investigation is carried out over three data frequencies (Monthly, Weekly, Daily), which allows for an investigation of temporal properties. Based on the methodology employed, likelihood ratio tests are used to compare among four stochastic data-generating processes. Maximum-likelihood estimation results suggest that jumps are important when examining high frequency (Daily) data, but the significance of jumps is ‘washed out’ at lower frequencies (Monthly). However, allowing for time-varying volatility calls into question the empirical relevance of jumps, even for higher frequency data.},

In recent times, researchers have directed their attention towards this ﬁeld. The objective of this paper is to provide a thorough overview of the advancements in quantum machine learning, encompassing the state-of-the-art approaches. The machine learning ﬁeld is itself quite diverse. Diversity of {QML} is broadened due to the respective roles the quantum information processing and machine learning play in it. The study focuses on analysing the predictive efﬁcacy of deep learning models on time series data. After experimental evaluation, we have chosen deep learning models that have better performance on time series data. The paper illustrates how different quantum techniques such as quantum encoding, optimization, etc., are used in quantum-enhanced models and provides a comprehensive review and an experimental analysis of three stateof-the-art quantum-enhanced models. Mental health is a serious global public health concern that has permeated modern civilization. So, seven time series data related to mental health conditions were collected from {SWELL}-{KW}, Wesad and psykose. Based on the experimental ﬁndings from the current dataset, it is evident that the quantum {LSTM} model exhibits superior predictive performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.},

            Time-series processing is a major challenge in machine learning with enormous progress in the last years in tasks such as speech recognition and chaotic series prediction. A promising avenue for sequential data analysis is quantum machine learning, with computational models like quantum neural networks and reservoir computing. An open question is how to efficiently include quantum measurement in realistic protocols while retaining the needed processing memory and preserving the quantum advantage offered by large Hilbert spaces. In this work, we propose different measurement protocols and assess their efficiency in terms of resources, through theoretical predictions and numerical analysis. We show that it is possible to exploit the quantumness of the reservoir and to obtain ideal performance both for memory and forecasting tasks with two successful measurement protocols. One repeats part of the experiment after each projective measurement while the other employs weak measurements operating online at the trade-off where information can be extracted accurately and without hindering the needed memory, in spite of back-action effects. Our work establishes the conditions for efficient time-series processing paving the way to its implementation in different quantum technologies.},

Recent papers have experimentally clariﬁed the meaning and practical signiﬁcance of weak measurements, yet in Kastner (Found Phys 47:697–707, 2017), Kastner seems to take us many years backwards in the the debate, casting doubt on the very term “weak value” and the meaning of weak measurements. Kastner appears to ignore both the basics and frontiers of weak measurements and misinterprets the weak measurement process and its outcomes. In addition, she accuses the authors of Aharonov et al. (Ann Phys 355:258–268, 2015) in statements completely opposite to the ones they have actually made. There are many points of disagreement between Kastner and us, but in this short reply I will leave aside the ontology (which is indeed interpretational and far more complex than that described by Kastner) and focus mainly on the injustice in her criticism. I shall add some general comments regarding the broader theory of weak measurements and the two-state-vector formalism, as well as supporting experimental results. Finally, I will point out some recent promising results, which can be proven by (strong) projective measurements, without the need of employing weak measurements.},

            Quantum reservoir computing is a promising approach for quantum neural networks, capable of solving hard learning tasks on both classical and quantum input data. However, current approaches with qubits suffer from limited connectivity. We propose an implementation for quantum reservoir that obtains a large number of densely connected neurons by using parametrically coupled quantum oscillators instead of physically coupled qubits. We analyze a specific hardware implementation based on superconducting circuits: with just two coupled quantum oscillators, we create a quantum reservoir comprising up to 81 neurons. We obtain state-of-the-art accuracy of 99\% on benchmark tasks that otherwise require at least 24 classical oscillators to be solved. Our results give the coupling and dissipation requirements in the system and show how they affect the performance of the quantum reservoir. Beyond quantum reservoir computing, the use of parametrically coupled bosonic modes holds promise for realizing large quantum neural network architectures, with billions of neurons implemented with only 10 coupled quantum oscillators.},

This is in contrast to the conventional application of reservoir computing that concentrates on the prediction of the dynamics of observables. In addition, we apply a technique which we refer to as skipping ahead to predict far future states accurately without the need to extract information about the intermediate states. However, adopting a classical {NG}-{RC} for many-body quantum dynamics prediction is computationally prohibitive due to the large Hilbert space of sample input data. In this work, we propose an end-to-end quantum algorithm for many-body quantum dynamics forecasting with a quantum computational speedup via the block-encoding technique.

Considering the prevalent use of projective measurements in quantum computing and communication protocols, the potential benefits of weak measurements in these fields remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that incorporating weak measurements into a quantum machine-learning protocol known as quantum reservoir computing provides advantages in both execution time scaling and overall performance. We analyze different measurement settings by varying the measurement strength across two benchmarking tasks. Our results reveal that carefully optimizing both the reservoir Hamiltonian parameters and the measurement strength can significantly improve the quantum reservoir computing algorithm performance. This work provides a comprehensive and practical recipe to promote the implementation of weak measurement-based protocols in quantum reservoir computing.

We show that any \$n\$-qubit quantum state can be prepared with a \${\textbackslash}Theta(n)\$-depth circuit using only single- and two-qubit gates, although with a cost of an exponential amount of ancillary qubits. On the other hand, for sparse quantum states with \$d{\textbackslash}geqslant2\$ non-zero entries, we can reduce the circuit depth to \${\textbackslash}Theta({\textbackslash}log(nd))\$ with \$O(nd{\textbackslash}log d)\$ ancillary qubits. The algorithm for sparse states is exponentially faster than best-known results and the number of ancillary qubits is nearly optimal and only increases polynomially with the system size. We discuss applications of the results in different quantum computing tasks, such as Hamiltonian simulation, solving linear systems of equations, and realizing quantum random access memories, and find cases with exponential reductions of the circuit depth for all these three tasks. In particular, using our algorithm, we find a family of linear system solving problems enjoying exponential speedups, even compared to the best-known quantum and classical dequantization algorithms.},

            Quantum computers have enabled solving problems beyond the current machines’ capabilities. However, this requires handling noise arising from unwanted interactions in these systems. Several protocols have been proposed to address efficient and accurate quantum noise profiling and mitigation. In this work, we propose a novel protocol that efficiently estimates the average output of a noisy quantum device to be used for quantum noise mitigation. The multi-qubit system average behavior is approximated as a special form of a Pauli Channel where Clifford gates are used to estimate the average output for circuits of different depths. The characterized Pauli channel error rates, and state preparation and measurement errors are then used to construct the outputs for different depths thereby eliminating the need for large simulations and enabling efficient mitigation. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed protocol on four {IBM} Q 5-qubit quantum devices. Our method demonstrates improved accuracy with efficient noise characterization. We report up to 88\% and 69\% improvement for the proposed approach compared to the unmitigated, and pure measurement error mitigation approaches, respectively.},

            Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms provide ways to use noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers for practical applications. Expanding the portfolio of such techniques, we propose a quantum circuit learning algorithm that can be used to assist the characterization of quantum devices and to train shallow circuits for generative tasks. The procedure leverages quantum hardware capabilities to its fullest extent by using native gates and their qubit connectivity. We demonstrate that our approach can learn an optimal preparation of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, also known as “cat states”. We further demonstrate that our approach can efficiently prepare approximate representations of coherent thermal states, wave functions that encode Boltzmann probabilities in their amplitudes. Finally, complementing proposals to characterize the power or usefulness of near-term quantum devices, such as {IBM}’s quantum volume, we provide a new hardware-independent metric called the {qBAS} score. It is based on the performance yield in a specific sampling task on one of the canonical machine learning data sets known as Bars and Stripes. We show how entanglement is a key ingredient in encoding the patterns of this data set; an ideal benchmark for testing hardware starting at four qubits and up. We provide experimental results and evaluation of this metric to probe the trade off between several architectural circuit designs and circuit depths on an ion-trap quantum computer.},

However, similar to the leading implicit generative models in deep learning, such as the generative adversarial networks, the quantum circuits cannot provide the likelihood of the generated samples, which poses a challenge to the training. We devise an efficient gradient-based learning algorithm for the quantum circuit Born machine by minimizing the kerneled maximum mean discrepancy loss.

In this paper we test {QCBM} performance on a dataset of spot {FX} log-returns (heavy-tailed distribution) as well as a specially constructed mixture of normal distributions (which models spikey light-tailed distributions). The {QCBM} has greater expressive power than comparable classical neural networks such as the restricted Boltzmann machine ({RBM}) and, therefore, has potential to demonstrate quantum advantage by generating high-quality samples from the learned empirical distribution of the market risk factors while using less computational resources than its classical counterpart. However, efficient training of the {QCBM} remains a challenging problem. The traditional differentiable learning approach may not work well when the loss function is highly non-smooth. In such cases it may be more efficient to use the nondifferentiable learning methods. This paper proposes a non-differentiable learning approach to the training of the {QCBM} based on a genetic algorithm ({GA}). The paper also presents the results of the numerical experiments which compare the performance of the {QCBM} trained with a {GA} against the performance of the equivalent classical {RBM} and investigates the question of {GA} convergence as a function of {QCBM} architecture and the choice of algorithm’s hyperparameters.},

            When analyzing the data sampled at discrete times, one encounters successive discontinuities in the trajectory of the sampled time series, even if the underlying path is continuous. On the other hand, the distinction between discontinuities caused by finite sampling of continuous stochastic process and real discontinuities in the sample path is one of the main problems. Clues like these led us to the question: Is it possible to provide a model that treats any random variation in the data set as a jump event, regardless of whether the given time series is classified as diffusion or jump-diffusion processes? To address this question, we wrote a new stochastic dynamical equation, which includes a drift term and a combination of Poisson jump processes with different distributed sizes. In this article, we first introduce this equation in its simplest form including a drift term and a jump process, and show that such a jump-drift equation is able to describe the discrete time evolution of a diffusion process. Afterwards, we extend the modeling by considering more jump processes in the equation, which can be used to model complex systems with various distributed amplitudes. At each step, we also show that all the unknown functions and parameters required for modeling can be obtained non-parametrically from the measured time series.},

The sources of incompleteness are illiquidity, non-tradable risk factors, discrete hedging dates and proportional transaction costs. Hedging strategies induced by the algorithms introduced in this paper are compared to classical stochastic control techniques on several payoﬀs using a {MSE} criterion. Some of the proposed algorithms are ﬂexible enough to deal with innovative loss criteria and P\&L distribution of the hedging strategies obtained with these new criteria are compared to P\&L distribution obtained with the classical {MSE} criterion. The most eﬃcient algorithm is tested on a case with non-zero transaction costs and we show how to obtain a whole Pareto frontier in a single training phase by randomly combining the criteria of average cost and variance during the learning phase.},

	abstract = {Synthetic data generation has proven to be a promising solution for addressing data availability issues in various domains. Even more challenging is the generation of synthetic time series data, where one has to preserve temporal dynamics, i.e., the generated time series must respect the original relationships between variables across time. Recently proposed techniques such as generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) and quantum-{GANs} lack the ability to attend to the time series specific temporal correlations adequately. We propose using the inherent nature of quantum computers to simulate quantum dynamics as a technique to encode such features. We start by assuming that a given time series can be generated by a quantum process, after which we proceed to learn that quantum process using quantum machine learning. We then use the learned model to generate out-of-sample time series and show that it captures unique and complex features of the learned time series. We also study the class of time series that can be modeled using this technique. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the proposed algorithm on an 11-qubit trapped-ion quantum machine.},

We prove that the quantum neural networks we use are trainable, and we perform extensive simulations that show that quantum models can reduce the number of trainable parameters while achieving comparable performance and that the distributional approach obtains better performance than other standard approaches, both classical and quantum. We successfully implement the proposed models on a trapped-ion quantum processor, utilizing circuits with up to \$16\$ qubits, and observe performance that agrees well with noiseless simulation. Our quantum techniques are general and can be applied to other reinforcement learning problems beyond hedging.},

Adding input features when learning the residuals enhances hedging performance more for puts than calls, with market sentiment being less crucial. Furthermore, learning the residuals with three years of data matches the hedging performance of directly learning with ten years of data, proving that our method demands less data.},

The method calculates the Shannon entropy of each of the data points from a point-cloud, hence, samples from an embedded manifold, and calculates the expanded concept of pseudo-entropy applied to each respective quantum operator that comes from a given quantum feature map, and not the density operator. In the recent decade, there has been a continuous advancement of translating machine learning into a quantum circuit with many promising results. For quantum machine learning, a major underlying question is how to encode real-world data into a quantum circuit without losing information and adding noise. A few notable methods derived are expressibility, where the distribution of the output of states from the circuit are compared against the Haar probability measure with information theoretic techniques, and expressivity, a method that maps the expectation of a quantum circuit to the space of complex functions via a partial Fourier series, noting that more intricate the function the more expressive, and using the symmetry embedded within the data to derive a quantum feature map. The proposed pseudo-entropy method is discussed to and empirically shown to generalize these methods. Furthermore, this method is argued to also generalize symmetric quantum feature maps. The discussions and arguments are a reasonable basis for understanding the connections but require deeper mathematical analysis.},

We show that these new quantities provide a natural and simple parametrization of all option price models satisfying the natural static arbitrage bounds across strikes. We next characterize absence of dynamic arbitrage for such models in terms of drift restrictions on the model coefﬁcients. For the resulting inﬁnite system of {SDEs} for the price level and all local implied volatilities, we then study the question of solvability and provide sufﬁcient conditions for existence and uniqueness of a solution.

	abstract = {In both modern stochastic analysis and more traditional probability and statistics, one way of characterizing a static or dynamic distribution is through its quantile function. A direct understanding of this function oﬀers tangible beneﬁts not available directly from the density function. For example, the simplest way of simulating any non-uniform random variable is by applying its quantile function to uniform deviates. Modern methods of Monte-Carlo simulation, techniques based on low-discrepancy sequences and copula methods all call for the use of quantile functions of marginal distributions. We propose a new approach to quantiles based ﬁrst, for the static case, on non-linear ordinary diﬀerential equations, which we solve by the classical method of power series with easily computed non-linear recursion relations for the coeﬃcients. These methods provide accuracy beyond standard machine precision on subsets of the unit interval and are well adapted to the benchmarking of approximate techniques, and, for some cases, live simulation. We provide some web links to implementations that may be starting points for the inclusion of these algorithms in simulation methods. Next, we consider the time evolution of quantiles via the quantilized Fokker-Planck equation. This is a non-linear partial diﬀerential equation and we are able to utilize the static formulation to provide elementary time-dependent and equilibrium solutions.},
