	abstract = {In many commodity markets, the arrival of new information leads to unexpectedly rapid changes – or jumps – in commodity prices. Such arrivals suggest the assumption that log-return relatives are normally distributed may not hold. This article investigates the potential presence of such jumps in the price of crude oil, both in terms of spot prices and the futures prices. The investigation is carried out over three data frequencies (Monthly, Weekly, Daily), which allows for an investigation of temporal properties. Based on the methodology employed, likelihood ratio tests are used to compare among four stochastic data-generating processes. Maximum-likelihood estimation results suggest that jumps are important when examining high frequency (Daily) data, but the significance of jumps is ‘washed out’ at lower frequencies (Monthly). However, allowing for time-varying volatility calls into question the empirical relevance of jumps, even for higher frequency data.},

In recent times, researchers have directed their attention towards this ﬁeld. The objective of this paper is to provide a thorough overview of the advancements in quantum machine learning, encompassing the state-of-the-art approaches. The machine learning ﬁeld is itself quite diverse. Diversity of QML is broadened due to the respective roles the quantum information processing and machine learning play in it. The study focuses on analysing the predictive efﬁcacy of deep learning models on time series data. After experimental evaluation, we have chosen deep learning models that have better performance on time series data. The paper illustrates how different quantum techniques such as quantum encoding, optimization, etc., are used in quantum-enhanced models and provides a comprehensive review and an experimental analysis of three stateof-the-art quantum-enhanced models. Mental health is a serious global public health concern that has permeated modern civilization. So, seven time series data related to mental health conditions were collected from SWELL-KW, Wesad and psykose. Based on the experimental ﬁndings from the current dataset, it is evident that the quantum LSTM model exhibits superior predictive performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.},

            Time-series processing is a major challenge in machine learning with enormous progress in the last years in tasks such as speech recognition and chaotic series prediction. A promising avenue for sequential data analysis is quantum machine learning, with computational models like quantum neural networks and reservoir computing. An open question is how to efficiently include quantum measurement in realistic protocols while retaining the needed processing memory and preserving the quantum advantage offered by large Hilbert spaces. In this work, we propose different measurement protocols and assess their efficiency in terms of resources, through theoretical predictions and numerical analysis. We show that it is possible to exploit the quantumness of the reservoir and to obtain ideal performance both for memory and forecasting tasks with two successful measurement protocols. One repeats part of the experiment after each projective measurement while the other employs weak measurements operating online at the trade-off where information can be extracted accurately and without hindering the needed memory, in spite of back-action effects. Our work establishes the conditions for efficient time-series processing paving the way to its implementation in different quantum technologies.},

Kastner appears to ignore both the basics and frontiers of weak measurements and misinterprets the weak measurement process and its outcomes. In addition, she accuses the authors of Aharonov et al. (Ann Phys 355:258–268, 2015) in statements completely opposite to the ones they have actually made. There are many points of disagreement between Kastner and us, but in this short reply I will leave aside the ontology (which is indeed interpretational and far more complex than that described by Kastner) and focus mainly on the injustice in her criticism. I shall add some general comments regarding the broader theory of weak measurements and the two-state-vector formalism, as well as supporting experimental results. Finally, I will point out some recent promising results, which can be proven by (strong) projective measurements, without the need of employing weak measurements.},

            Quantum reservoir computing is a promising approach for quantum neural networks, capable of solving hard learning tasks on both classical and quantum input data. However, current approaches with qubits suffer from limited connectivity. We propose an implementation for quantum reservoir that obtains a large number of densely connected neurons by using parametrically coupled quantum oscillators instead of physically coupled qubits. We analyze a specific hardware implementation based on superconducting circuits: with just two coupled quantum oscillators, we create a quantum reservoir comprising up to 81 neurons. We obtain state-of-the-art accuracy of 99\% on benchmark tasks that otherwise require at least 24 classical oscillators to be solved. Our results give the coupling and dissipation requirements in the system and show how they affect the performance of the quantum reservoir. Beyond quantum reservoir computing, the use of parametrically coupled bosonic modes holds promise for realizing large quantum neural network architectures, with billions of neurons implemented with only 10 coupled quantum oscillators.},

We demonstrate that NG-RC can accurately predict full many-body quantum dynamics in both integrable and chaotic systems. This is in contrast to the conventional application of reservoir computing that concentrates on the prediction of the dynamics of observables. In addition, we apply a technique which we refer to as skipping ahead to predict far future states accurately without the need to extract information about the intermediate states. However, adopting a classical NG-RC for many-body quantum dynamics prediction is computationally prohibitive due to the large Hilbert space of sample input data. In this work, we propose an end-to-end quantum algorithm for many-body quantum dynamics forecasting with a quantum computational speedup via the block-encoding technique. This proposal presents an efﬁcient model-free quantum scheme to forecast quantum dynamics coherently, bypassing inductive biases incurred in a model-based approach.},

In this work, we demonstrate that incorporating weak measurements into a quantum machine-learning protocol known as quantum reservoir computing provides advantages in both execution time scaling and overall performance. We analyze different measurement settings by varying the measurement strength across two benchmarking tasks. Our results reveal that carefully optimizing both the reservoir Hamiltonian parameters and the measurement strength can significantly improve the quantum reservoir computing algorithm performance. This work provides a comprehensive and practical recipe to promote the implementation of weak measurement-based protocols in quantum reservoir computing. Moreover, our findings motivate further exploration of experimental protocols that leverage the back-action effects of weak measurements.},

	abstract = {Quantum state preparation is an important subroutine for quantum computing. We show that any \$n\$-qubit quantum state can be prepared with a \${\textbackslash}Theta(n)\$-depth circuit using only single- and two-qubit gates, although with a cost of an exponential amount of ancillary qubits. On the other hand, for sparse quantum states with \$d{\textbackslash}geqslant2\$ non-zero entries, we can reduce the circuit depth to \${\textbackslash}Theta({\textbackslash}log(nd))\$ with \$O(nd{\textbackslash}log d)\$ ancillary qubits. The algorithm for sparse states is exponentially faster than best-known results and the number of ancillary qubits is nearly optimal and only increases polynomially with the system size. We discuss applications of the results in different quantum computing tasks, such as Hamiltonian simulation, solving linear systems of equations, and realizing quantum random access memories, and find cases with exponential reductions of the circuit depth for all these three tasks. In particular, using our algorithm, we find a family of linear system solving problems enjoying exponential speedups, even compared to the best-known quantum and classical dequantization algorithms.},

Compared to current state-of-the-art approaches in the literature, we find that for derivative contracts of practical interest, the application of QSP significantly reduces the required resources across all metrics considered, most notably the total number of T-gates by \${\textbackslash}sim 16\$x and the number of logical qubits by \${\textbackslash}sim 4\$x. Additionally, we estimate that the logical clock rate needed for quantum advantage is also reduced by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim 5\$x. Overall, we find that quantum advantage will require \$4.7\$k logical qubits, and quantum devices that can execute \$10{\textasciicircum}9\$ T-gates at a rate of \$45\$MHz.

            Quantum computers have enabled solving problems beyond the current machines’ capabilities. However, this requires handling noise arising from unwanted interactions in these systems. Several protocols have been proposed to address efficient and accurate quantum noise profiling and mitigation. In this work, we propose a novel protocol that efficiently estimates the average output of a noisy quantum device to be used for quantum noise mitigation. The multi-qubit system average behavior is approximated as a special form of a Pauli Channel where Clifford gates are used to estimate the average output for circuits of different depths. The characterized Pauli channel error rates, and state preparation and measurement errors are then used to construct the outputs for different depths thereby eliminating the need for large simulations and enabling efficient mitigation. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed protocol on four IBM Q 5-qubit quantum devices. Our method demonstrates improved accuracy with efficient noise characterization. We report up to 88\% and 69\% improvement for the proposed approach compared to the unmitigated, and pure measurement error mitigation approaches, respectively.},

            Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms provide ways to use noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers for practical applications. Expanding the portfolio of such techniques, we propose a quantum circuit learning algorithm that can be used to assist the characterization of quantum devices and to train shallow circuits for generative tasks. The procedure leverages quantum hardware capabilities to its fullest extent by using native gates and their qubit connectivity. We demonstrate that our approach can learn an optimal preparation of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, also known as “cat states”. We further demonstrate that our approach can efficiently prepare approximate representations of coherent thermal states, wave functions that encode Boltzmann probabilities in their amplitudes. Finally, complementing proposals to characterize the power or usefulness of near-term quantum devices, such as IBM’s quantum volume, we provide a new hardware-independent metric called the qBAS score. It is based on the performance yield in a specific sampling task on one of the canonical machine learning data sets known as Bars and Stripes. We show how entanglement is a key ingredient in encoding the patterns of this data set; an ideal benchmark for testing hardware starting at four qubits and up. We provide experimental results and evaluation of this metric to probe the trade off between several architectural circuit designs and circuit depths on an ion-trap quantum computer.},

One can efficiently draw samples from the quantum circuits via projective measurements on qubits. However, similar to the leading implicit generative models in deep learning, such as the generative adversarial networks, the quantum circuits cannot provide the likelihood of the generated samples, which poses a challenge to the training. We devise an efficient gradient-based learning algorithm for the quantum circuit Born machine by minimizing the kerneled maximum mean discrepancy loss. We simulated generative modeling of the Bars-and-Stripes dataset and Gaussian mixture distributions using deep quantum circuits. Our experiments show the importance of circuit depth and gradient-based optimization algorithm.

It is likely that the QCBM will be one of the ﬁrst quantum machine learning models to ﬁnd productive applications in quantitative ﬁnance as a powerful market generator. In this paper we test QCBM performance on a dataset of spot FX log-returns (heavy-tailed distribution) as well as a specially constructed mixture of normal distributions (which models spikey light-tailed distributions). The QCBM has greater expressive power than comparable classical neural networks such as the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and, therefore, has potential to demonstrate quantum advantage by generating high-quality samples from the learned empirical distribution of the market risk factors while using less computational resources than its classical counterpart. However, efficient training of the QCBM remains a challenging problem. The traditional differentiable learning approach may not work well when the loss function is highly non-smooth. In such cases it may be more efficient to use the nondifferentiable learning methods. This paper proposes a non-differentiable learning approach to the training of the QCBM based on a genetic algorithm (GA). The paper also presents the results of the numerical experiments which compare the performance of the QCBM trained with a GA against the performance of the equivalent classical RBM and investigates the question of GA convergence as a function of QCBM architecture and the choice of algorithm’s hyperparameters.},

In this paper, we introduce a new type of neural network layer called Pyramidal Circuit, which implements an orthogonal matrix multiplication. It allows for gradient descent with perfect orthogonality with the same asymptotic running time as a standard layer. This algorithm is inspired by quantum computing and can therefore be applied on a classical computer as well as on a near term quantum computer.

            When analyzing the data sampled at discrete times, one encounters successive discontinuities in the trajectory of the sampled time series, even if the underlying path is continuous. On the other hand, the distinction between discontinuities caused by finite sampling of continuous stochastic process and real discontinuities in the sample path is one of the main problems. Clues like these led us to the question: Is it possible to provide a model that treats any random variation in the data set as a jump event, regardless of whether the given time series is classified as diffusion or jump-diffusion processes? To address this question, we wrote a new stochastic dynamical equation, which includes a drift term and a combination of Poisson jump processes with different distributed sizes. In this article, we first introduce this equation in its simplest form including a drift term and a jump process, and show that such a jump-drift equation is able to describe the discrete time evolution of a diffusion process. Afterwards, we extend the modeling by considering more jump processes in the equation, which can be used to model complex systems with various distributed amplitudes. At each step, we also show that all the unknown functions and parameters required for modeling can be obtained non-parametrically from the measured time series.},
